GER-01 | Initial Token Distribution

Recommendation to declare the initial token issuance amount globally and change it so that it can be checked externally

Alternative 1)

Specifying the initial issuance amount in a global variable

GER-02 | Mintable Token

The mint method is centralized in Certic Reports, so there is a transparency problem and hackers can
There is a security advisory that it can be dangerous when the minter role's private key is stolen.

Alternative 1)

Decentralize the minter role to 2-3 with multi-sig, and 2 to 3 signatures when executing actual minting

Alternative 2)

GER-03 | Invisible Implementation Of Contract (antisnipe)

The implementation of the antisnipe contract is not revealed in the bsc chain, only abi is exposed.
West
 The reply is that the contract evaluation is not possible.

Alternative 1)

After requesting the contract source code from antisnipe, it is provided to Certic

GER-04 | Third Party Dependencies


It is pointed out that there is an external dependency, and the vulnerability of errors that can occur in the contract is

   It is an opinion that it may be.

Alternative 1)

It is a necessary dependency for Goldefy business logic, and the contract is already connected to other contracts.
no problem
I think it would be good to send feedback to Certic that it is being used.

GER-05 | Centralization Risk In GoldefyERC20.sol

The methods to which the Ownable modifier is applied are centralized and the owner's private key is stolen.
This is a security advisory that it can be dangerous if it happens again.

GER-06 | Missing Error Messages

It is a recommendation that there is no revert message when checking requires.

Alternative 1)

This can be solved by providing an appropriate message when require revert
